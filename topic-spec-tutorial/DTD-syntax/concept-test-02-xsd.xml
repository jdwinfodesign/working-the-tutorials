	<title>Can I add attributes to specific element types?</title>
	<shortdesc>No, you can only define global attributes, specialized either from @base
		or @props.</shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>As of DITA 1.2, there is no mechanism for defining new attributes for specific element types.
			The problem is that there is no DITA-defined syntax for declaring a given attribute as being
			an attribute that should be recognized as such by a DITA-aware processor and not just some
			random attribute that was allowed in error (as the DITA architecture otherwise does not 
			allow non-DITA-defined attributes.</p>
		<p>Providing this ability is a booked feature request for DITA.</p>
